                        My enthusiasm for coding stems from that it bridges creativity and problem-solving. I'm a web developer with both front- and back-end skills, driven to help others bring their stories to life and build their business' online presence. 
                        I have commercial experience debugging, maintaining and building from the ground up responsive, user-friendly and SEO compliant websites in collaboration with other developers, designers and marketers.
                        I'm now looking for a challenging position where I would work on a team that follows best practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming to help me learn and grow as a developer.

                      At Make, I test, debug, maintain and develop websites utilising WordPress, PHP and CSS/Sass and Bootstrap. I have gained experience working with payment gateway integration with plugins, such as Stripe, and an understanding of marketing platforms and softwares such as Mailchimp and Salesforce.
                      I have worked on small-scale projects and bigger brands' websites (e.g., Myo Band). I enjoy the variety of tasks given to me and working closely with designers to fulfill our clients' needs.

                      As a teaching assistant, I led some of the morning stand-ups using the Agile methodology to monitor students' progress and keep them motivated. I improved my understanding of coding principles by helping them with their personal and/or team projects. 
                      I also enhanced my communication skills by presenting and leading a few workshops.
